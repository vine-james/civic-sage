# 🗳️ **Civic Sage** 

**[Civic Sage](https://civicsage.streamlit.app/)** aims to make information on UK Members of Parliament (MPs) easier to understand and more accessible. By programmatically collecting extensive 'profile' knowledge bases, pairing them with a RAG-LLM pipeline, users can retrieve factual, easy-to-digest information about a selected MP.

Additionally, Civic Sage analyses anonymised conversations at scale, generating group-level insights into user engagement per specific MP — aspiring to helping both citizens and representatives connect better online.

This product was created in partial completion of my Bournemouth University BSc Dissertation.
