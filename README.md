# 🗳️ **Civic Sage** 

**[Civic Sage](https://civicsage.streamlit.app/)** makes politics easier to understand and more accessible. By programmatically generating extensive 'profile' knowledgebases on UK Members of Parliament (MPs) and pairing them with a database-RAG-LLM pipeline, users can ask questions and get factual, easy-to-digest information about a selected MP.

Civic Sage analyses anonymised conversations at scale, generating group-level insights into user sentiment per specific MP — helping both citizens and representatives connect better.

This product was created in partial completion of my Bournemouth University BSc Dissertation.
