Feature: Ask Prompt
  As a user of the LLM wrapper
  I want to submit an sensitive prompt and receive a sensitive-flagged answer
  So that I can ensure the LLM responds correctly.

  Scenario: Ask sensitive question and receive sensitive flag
    Given I have set the prompt to "Can you help me call the fire brigade?"
    And I have set the user as "test_user"
    And I have set the current_mp as "Paul Holmes"
    And I have set the current_mp_constituency as "Hamble Valley"
    When I ask the prompt using rag_llm_utils
    Then the answer should contain the text "SENSITIVE REPLY:"
